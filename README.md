## Apps for counting words or categories, and viewing them in context

This is experimental code with no guarantee of working at all.
All subject to change.

### Applications

* `ykcats`

  A command line application to 
  apply a Yoshikoder dictionary to a bunch of files and
  record the result in a CSV file.

* `ykwords`

  A command line application to
  count words and drop the results in LDAC or Matrix Market format in a folder.

* `ykconc`
  
  A command line application to 
  construct concordances ('keyword in context' lines) for a word, phrase, 
  or category from a content analysis dictionary, for a bunch of documents.

### Compilation

To compile, type `ant`. 

Installation instructions are on the [project wiki](https://github.com/conjugateprior/jca/wiki)

Windows executables are on the way.  Probably.  If I can find a
Windows machine to test them on.  Or I guess Windows people could get
a proper command line interface from <http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/>
