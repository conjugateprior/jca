## LDA-C Format

This folder contains three or four files:

	words.csv
	documents.csv
	unreadable-files.txt (is there are any)
	data.ldac
	
documents.csv lists the files that were successfully processed,
unreadable-files.txt list the files that could not be read, and
words.csv lists the word types found in the readable documents.

The file data.ldac contains lines of the following form

	N [A:B]+
	
Following the LDA-C format, the K-th such line represents that 
the document whose title is the Kth line of documents.csv contains
the word listed in the A+1th line of words.csv B times. 
Note: A indexes from zero. N denotes the number of distinct word types
in the document.

See http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/readme.txt sec.B.2
for details.

## Note on text2ldac

If you have used the python script text2ldac then the documents.csv
corresponds to the .dmap file, words.csv to the .vocab file and 
data.ldac to the .dat file produced by that software.

## Note on topic model packages in R

To read the word counts stored here in sparse LDA-C format into R from 
an output folder called 'folder'

	require(lda) 
	documents <- read.documents("folder/data.ldac")
	vocab <- read.vocab("folder/words.csv")

The topicmodels package has an ldaformat2dtm function to transform this into 
TermDocumentMatrix objects, as used by the tm package.
