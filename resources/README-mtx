## Matrix Market format

This folder contains three files:

	words.csv
	documents.csv
	data.mtx
	
The file data.mtx is in Matrix Market 'coordinate' format. This consists 
of a header and lines of the form

    A B C
    
where A, B, and C are the row number, column number, and value respectively 
of asingle element of the document by term word count matrix.  The document
named on line A of documents.csv contains the word named on line B of words.csv
C times. Further details are at http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html

## Reading Matrix Market format into R

To read the word counts stored here in sparse Matrix Market format into R use:

    read.mtx <- function(folder){ 
      require(Matrix)
      ff <- readMM(file.path(folder, "data.mtx"))
      rown <- read.csv(file.path(folder, "documents.csv"), header=FALSE)$V1 
      coln <- read.csv(file.path(folder, "words.csv"), header=FALSE)$V1
      dimnames(ff) <- list(documents=rown, words=coln)
      ff
    } 

To read the word counts stored here in Matrix Market format into R from 
an output folder called 'folder' 

    wcm <- read.mtx("folder")
